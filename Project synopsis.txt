Firing patterns can be defined by the space occupied by all the fitting parameters of the model.

If the model is biophysical, a direction can be made about what changes in the treatment will created the wanted firing patterns which performed wanted function. Or a treatment can be specified to shift away from the unwanted firing patterns.

A HH model is modified to account for more firing patterns.
An already existed simulator likes NEURON can be customized but the degrees of freedom for the modification is limited, especially to the choices of ion channel modelings. Hence, dedicated code written for this project is used.

The result is a map between a set of points in the biophysically meaningful parameter space to a set of points in the parameter space describing the shape of different firing patterns
